Software Architecture in Practice

Big data example - Using MongoDB

by Henrik B Christensen, AU 2012

================================

To experiment with MongoDB's facilities we need a somewhat large
database. The guide below details the process to get data into
Mongo DB. It is based on chapter 6 from the Wiley book "Professional
NoSQL" by Shashank Tiwari. I can highly recommend the book if you
want to get hands on.

Getting the Data into Mongo
===========================

Raw data files
--------------
The data source is a set of movie ratings, published by Movielens.
The data can be found at grouplens.org/node/73.

Download MovieLens 1M Data Set (.zip) and unpack it in some
suitable place.

However - on my Windows platform I ran into encoding problems and
resorted to (manual!) removing the offending characters from the
movies.dat file (sorry to all the french movies). 

I have permission by John Riedl to host an edited version of this file
on a password protected site, so download it from the link provided in
the mandatory exercise description.

Get the Raw-Mongo converter script
----------------------------------

This is available at the book's web site: wrox.com. Please follow
this link:

http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-NoSQL.productCd-047094224X,descCd-DOWNLOAD.html

and click the 'click to download'.

In the zip file, open folder 'ch06/ch06' and get the ruby script

movielens_dataloader.rb

and copy it to the folder where you have your movie lens .dat files.

Get Ruby
--------

Sigh - the script uses the Ruby language. 

I used 

http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

and selected the RubyInstaller for version 1.9.3
  (I selected that the installer should add ruby to the PATH).

Get Mongo driver for Ruby
-------------------------

Open a shell and use the ruby package installer to get 
the drivers by issuing these commands in the shell:

 gem update --system   (Ubuntu will not let you do that, works anyway)
 gem install mongo     (prefix with 'sudo' on Ubuntu)
 gem install bson
 gem install bson_ext	(fails on Ubuntu, works anyway)

It is explained in detail at

http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ruby+Language+Center

Start Mongo DB
--------------

On Windows, run the mongod.exe.

More detail at

http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Starting+and+Stopping+Mongo

Convert the raw data
--------------------

Open a shell in the folder containing the three .dat files from
MovieLens. Now convert each of the .dat files like this

ruby movielens_dataloader.rb users.dat
ruby movielens_dataloader.rb movies-edit.dat
ruby movielens_dataloader.rb ratings.dat

(the ratings.dat is the big one and takes some time to chew.)

Done!

Validating the DB
=================

Open the mongo console (mongo.exe in Windows). The database
is called 'mydb', so tell the mongo JavaScript shell to use that

use mydb

To see how many ratings there are:

db.ratings.count();

I get about 1 mio ratings.
